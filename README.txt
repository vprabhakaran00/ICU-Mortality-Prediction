This Django project is a hospital mortality prediction platform. 

The user first inputs 8 patient admission features into the home page. After submission, the user is redirected to the input success page,
where the user could view the result or go back to data entry. The user could see visualizations that summarize previous entries in the
summary page. 


NOTE: xgboost, pandas, joblib must be installed in the terminal in order to run the project properly:

pip install xgboost
pip install pandas
pip install joblib
