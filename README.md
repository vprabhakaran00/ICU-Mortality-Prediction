# ICU-Mortality-Prediction

Project developed in collaboration with Mai Tran (1995maitran@gmail.com) and Andrew Liu (andrewliu.js@gmail.com) of Langara College in Vancouver BC.

This Django project is an ICU mortality prediction platform. 

The user first inputs 8 patient admission features into the home page. After submission, the user is redirected to the input success page,
where the user could view the result or go back to data entry. The user could see visualizations that summarize previous entries in the
summary page.
